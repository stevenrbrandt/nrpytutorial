    "# Generating C Code to implement Method of Lines Timestepping for Explicit Runge Kutta Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authors: Zach Etienne & Brandon Clark\n",
    "\n",
    "## This tutorial notebook generates three blocks of C Code in order to perform Method of Lines timestepping. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Status:** <font color='green'><b> Validated </b></font>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation Notes:** This tutorial notebook has been confirmed to be self-consistent with its corresponding NRPy+ module, as documented [below](#code_validation). All Runge-Kutta (RK) Butcher tables were validated using truncated Taylor series in [a separate module](Tutorial-RK_Butcher_Table_Validation.ipynb). Finally, C-code implementation of RK4 was validated against a trusted version. C-code implementations of other RK methods seem to work as expected in the context of solving the scalar wave equation in Cartesian coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NRPy+ Source Code for this module: \n",
    "* [MoLtimestepping/C_Code_Generation.py](../edit/MoLtimestepping/C_Code_Generation.py)\n",
    "* [MoLtimestepping/RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.py](../edit/MoLtimestepping/RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.py) ([**Tutorial**](Tutorial-RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.ipynb)) stores the Butcher tables for the explicit Runge Kutta methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "When numerically solving a partial differential equation initial-value problem, subject to suitable boundary conditions,  we implement Method of Lines to \"integrate\" the solution forward in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Method of Lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the initial data for a PDE, we \"evolve it forward in time\", using the [Method of Lines](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/NDSolveMethodOfLines.html). In short, the Method of Lines enables us to handle \n",
    "1. the **spatial derivatives** of an initial value problem PDE using **standard finite difference approaches**, and\n",
    "2. the **temporal derivatives** of an initial value problem PDE using **standard strategies for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), like Runge Kutta methods** so long as the initial value problem PDE can be written in the first-order-in-time form\n",
    "$$\\partial_t \\vec{f} = \\mathbf{M}\\ \\vec{f},$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{M}$ is an $N\\times N$ matrix containing only *spatial* differential operators that act on the $N$-element column vector $\\vec{f}$. $\\mathbf{M}$ may not contain $t$ or time derivatives explicitly; only *spatial* partial derivatives are allowed to appear inside $\\mathbf{M}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find the module [Tutorial-ScalarWave](Tutorial-ScalarWave.ipynb) extremely helpful as an example for implementing the Method of Lines for solving the Scalar Wave equation in Cartesian coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating the C code:\n",
    "\n",
    "This module describes how core C functions are generated to implement Method of Lines timestepping for a specified RK method. There are three core functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. allocate memory for gridfunctions,\n",
    "1. step forward the solution one full timestep,\n",
    "1. and free memory for gridfunctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first function is called first, then the second function is repeated within a loop to a fixed \"final\" time (such that the end state of each iteration is the initial state for the next iteration), and the third function is called at the end of the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated codes are essential for a number of Start-to-Finish example tutorial notebooks that demonstrate how to numerically solve hyperbolic PDEs."

    "## Step 3.c: Take one Method of Lines time step:  `MoL_step_forward_in_time()` [Back to [top](#toc)\\]\n",
    "$$\\label{molstep}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An MoL step consists in general of a series of Runge-Kutta-like substeps, and the `MoL_step_forward_in_time()` C function pulls together all of these substeps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic C code for an MoL substep, set up by the Python function `single_RK_substep()` below, is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate the right-hand side of $\\partial_t \\vec{f}=$ `RHS`, to get the time derivative of the set of gridfunctions $\\vec{f}$ at our current time.\n",
    "1. Perform the Runge-Kutta update, which depends on $\\partial_t \\vec{f}$ on the current and sometimes previous times.\n",
    "1. Call post-right-hand side functions as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `single_RK_substep_input_symbolic()` function generates the C code for performing the above steps, applying substitutions for e.g., `RK_INPUT_GFS` and `RK_OUTPUT_GFS` as appropriate. `single_RK_substep_input_symbolic()` supports SIMD-capable code generation."
