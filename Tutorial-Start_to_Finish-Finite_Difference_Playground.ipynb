    "## Introduction: \n",
    "To illustrate how NRPy+-based codes can be used, we write a C code that makes use of the NRPy+-generated C code from the [previous module](Tutorial-Finite_Difference_Derivatives.ipynb). This is a rather silly example, as the C code generated by NRPy+ could be easily generated by hand. However, as we will see in later modules, NRPy+'s true strengths lie in its automatic handling of far more complex and generic expressions, in higher dimensions. For the time being, bear with NRPy+; its true powers will become clear soon!"
