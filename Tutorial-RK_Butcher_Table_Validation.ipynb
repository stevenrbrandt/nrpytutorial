    "\n",
    "### NRPy+ Source Code for this module: \n",
    "* [MoLtimestepping/RK_Butcher_Table_Validation.py](../edit/MoLtimestepping/RK_Butcher_Table_Validation.py) stores the `Validate` function for validating convergence orders for Runge Kutta methods.\n",

    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the ODE (ordinary differential equation) initial value problem:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y'(t) = f(y,t)\\ \\ \\ y\\left(t=0\\right)=y_0,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "for various choices of $f(y,t)$, this module validates the Runge Kutta (RK) methods coded in [RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.py](../edit/MoLtimestepping/RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.py) [**tutorial notebook**](Tutorial-RK_Butcher_Table_Dictionary.ipynb) as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $y_0$ and a smooth $f(y,t)$, all explicit RK methods provide an estimate for $y_1 = y\\left(\\Delta t\\right)$, with an error term that is proportional to $\\left(\\Delta t\\right)^m$, where $m$ is an integer typically greater than zero. This error term corresponds to the *local* truncation error. For RK4, for example, while the *total accumulated truncation error* (i.e., the accumulated error at a fixed final time $t_f$) is proportional to $\\left(\\Delta t\\right)^4$, the *local* truncation error (i.e., the error after one arbitrarily chosen timestep $\\Delta t$) is proportional to $\\left(\\Delta t\\right)^5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the exact solution $y(t)$ is known as a closed-form expression, then $y\\left(\\Delta t\\right)$ can be *separately* written as a Taylor expansion about $y(t=0)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y\\left(\\Delta t\\right) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{y^{(n)}(t=0)}{n!} \\left(\\Delta t\\right)^n,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $y^{(n)}(t=0)$ is the $n$th derivative of $y(t)$ evaluated at $t=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above expression will be known exactly. Furthermore, if one chooses a numerical value for $y_0$ *and leaves $\\Delta t$ unspecified*, any explicit RK method will provide an estimate for $y\\left(\\Delta t\\right)$ of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y\\left(\\Delta t\\right) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n \\left(\\Delta t\\right)^n,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $a_n$ *must* match the Taylor expansion of the *exact* solution at least up to and including terms proportional to $\\left(\\Delta t\\right)^m$, where $m$ is the order of the local truncation error. If this is *not* the case, then the Butcher table was almost certainly *not* typed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, comparing the numerical result with unspecified $\\Delta t$ against the exact Taylor series provides a convenient (though not perfectly robust) means to verify that the Butcher table for a given RK method was typed correctly. Multiple typos in the Butcher tables were found using this approach.\n",
