    "## Author: Zach Etienne\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special thanks to Roland Haas for help in answering many implementation questions\n",
    "\n",
    "## This notebook generates `Baikal` and `BaikalVacuum`, [Einstein Toolkit](https://einsteintoolkit.org) thorns for solving Einstein's equations in the BSSN formalism, in Cartesian coordinates. These thorns are highly optimized for modern CPU architectures, featuring SIMD intrinsics and OpenMP support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Status:** <font color='orange'><b> Validated against the Einstein Toolkit `McLachlan` BSSN thorn, both in the context of black hole binary simulations (excellent gravitational waveform agreement) as well as binary neutron star simulations (when parameter `enable_stress_energy_source_terms` below is set to `True`). Once plots demonstrating this agreement are added to this tutorial notebook, the validation status will be set to</b></font> <font color='green'><b>Validated</b></font>.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "How often did my soul cry out:\n",
    "Come back to Baikal once again?\n",
    "I still do not know this lake:\n",
    "To see does not mean to know.\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Igor Severyanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Severyanin), [[1]](https://1baikal.ru/en/istoriya/let’s-turn-to-baikal-a-poetic-view).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Lake Baikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal) is home to the [nerpa seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikal_seal), NRPy+'s mascot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook generates two thorns: `Baikal` and `BaikalVacuum`. `Baikal` contains stress-energy source terms (i.e., the $8\\pi T^{\\mu\\nu}$ part of Einstein's equations) for general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) and magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD), and the `BaikalVacuum` contains no such source terms, so can be used for e.g., black hole and binary black hole calculations in which no self-gravitating matter is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Baikal` and `BaikalVacuum` are meant to reproduce the functionality of the `McLachlan` thorn, generated by the [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)-based [Kranc](http://kranccode.org/) code, but using the fully open-source NRPy+/SymPy infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike `McLachlan`, `Baikal` and `BaikalVacuum` enable the user at runtime to select only the most popular options, like finite-difference order and Kreiss-Oliger dissipation strength. Further, neither thorn yet supports symmetry options or Jacobians needed for `Llama` grids. Support for these options might be provided in a future update. As for BSSN gauge choice, `Baikal` and `BaikalVacuum` by default support only the BSSN moving-puncture gauge conditions, though this can be changed by selecting one of the [other gauge choices implemented within the NRPy+ infrastructure](Tutorial-BSSN_time_evolution-BSSN_gauge_RHSs.ipynb).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Regarding the structure of this notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As generating the optimized C code kernels needed for these thorns can *individually* take roughly 10 minutes per finite-difference order, there is a strong motivation to parallelize the code generation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, this Jupyter notebook does not itself run Python code in most code blocks directly. Instead \n",
    "* code blocks needed to generate the C code kernels (i.e., the C-code representations of the basic equations) are simply output to the `$BaikalETKdir/BaikalETK_C_kernels_codegen.py` file using the `%%writefile` [IPython magic command](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html);\n",
    "* code blocks needed to generate the Einstein Toolkit (ETK) CCL files are output to `$BaikalETKdir/BaikalETK_ETK_ccl_files_codegen.py` file using the same IPython magic; and\n",
    "* code blocks needed to generate the C driver routines that call the C code kernels and interface with the rest of the ETK are output to `$BaikalETKdir/BaikalETK_C_drivers_codegen.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only non-`%%writefile` IPython magic codeblocks used in this notebook act as glue so that the above three Python modules can be called in sequence, with particular emphasis on generating the C code kernels in parallel (by calling multiple instances of the  Python module `$BaikalETKdir/BaikalETK_C_kernels_codegen.py`). On a modern, multi-core CPU, this greatly cuts down the time needed to generate the thorns (sometimes by 10x or more), all while ensuring a convenient user interface for adjusting the thorns to suit one's needs.\n",

    "NRPy+ is a code generation package that is designed to offer maximum flexibility *at the time of C code generation*. As a result, although NRPy+ can in principle output an infinite variety of C code kernels for solving Einstein's equations, generally free parameters in each kernel steerable at *runtime* are restricted to simple scalars. This leads to more optimized kernels (i.e., significantly improved performance as compared to `McLachlan`), but at the expense of flexibility in choosing e.g., different gauges at runtime (currently only the most commonly used gauge is supported), as well as the need to generate multiple kernels (one per finite-differencing order). Reducing the number of kernels and adding more flexibility at runtime will be a focus of future work.\n",

    "        * BSSN RHSs, Ricci tensor, Hamiltonian constraint, and $\\hat{\\gamma}=\\bar{\\gamma}$ constraint\n",
    "    * Kreiss-Oliger dissipation strength via runtime parameter `diss_strength`, which is the exact analogue of the `eps_diss` parameter of the `Dissipation` thorn\n",

In case you'd like to make another gauge choice, you need only choose the desired gauge from [the NRPy+ Python module](BSSN/BSSN_gauge_RHSs.py) and add it as parameters `ShiftCondition` and `LapseCondition` to the main BaikalETK code generation function `BaikalETK_C_kernels_codegen_onepart()`. You will find that adding user-defined gauge choices is a straightforward process, as the module is easily extended.\n",
